What is Priv?
Priv is just a little project put up by an internet user known as Dread or Dreahd, who likes messing around with PHP. Dread loves HTML and PHP, but he hates CSS. That's why the design of the site is a simple bootstrap design copied from startbootsrap.com. Priv will be an online messaging board for text and images. It's like 9gag, 4chan and Reddit. It going to have pictures like 9gag, it's anonymous as 4chan and it's open-source just like Reddit.
